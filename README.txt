---3D Surround Panner---
The main application is sound-panner.maxpat. Previous revisions of the application can be found in the revisions folder.

- Upon launch, the application will request an .aif file to play as the default audio source. You can cancel out of this if desired.
- config.txt and soundout.txt for configuration and panning data saving will appear in this folder once written. 
- An example of using rewire to output sound into a Max patch can be found in rewire.maxpat
